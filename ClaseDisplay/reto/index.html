            <p>BLEACH <br> Bleach is the debut studio album by American rock band Nirvana, released on June 15, 1989, by Sub Pop. After the release of their debut single "Love Buzz" on Sub Pop in November 1988, Nirvana rehearsed for two to three weeks in
                preparation for recording a full-length album. The main recording sessions for Bleach took place at Reciprocal Recording in Seattle, Washington between December 1988 and January 1989. It is the only Nirvana album released on the Sub Pop
                label and their only album to feature drummer Chad Channing. <br>
            </p>

            <p>NEVERMIND <br> Nevermind is the second studio album by American rock band Nirvana, released on September 24, 1991, by DGC Records. Produced by Butch Vig, it was Nirvana's first release on the DGC label, as well as the first to feature drummer
                Dave Grohl. Nevermind features a more polished, radio-friendly sound than the band's prior work, and is therefore considered a significant departure from their debut album, Bleach. Recording for Nevermind took place at Sound City Studios
                in Van Nuys, California, and Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin in May and June 1991, with mastering being completed in August of that year at The Mastering Lab in Hollywood, California.

            <p>IN UTERO <br> In Utero is the third and final studio album by the American rock band Nirvana, released on September 13, 1993, by DGC Records. Nirvana intended to depart from the more polished sound of their previous album, Nevermind (1991),
                with a greater range of sounds and moods. To capture a more abrasive and natural sound, they hired engineer Steve Albini to record In Utero over two weeks in February 1993 at Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, Minnesota. The lyrics and
                album packaging incorporated medical imagery that conveyed frontman Kurt Cobain's outlook on his publicized personal life and Nirvana's newfound fame.

            <p>MTV UNPLUGGED IN NEW YORK <br> MTV Unplugged in New York is a live album by American rock band Nirvana, released on November 1, 1994, by DGC Records. It features an acoustic performance recorded at Sony Music Studios in New York City on November
                18, 1993, for the television series MTV Unplugged.
